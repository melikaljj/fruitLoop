## Library used and taken from?
The API project for the Programming II course is based on Animate on Scroll (AOS) library by michalsnik found on http://michalsnik.github.io/aos/

## What the project does?

- It explores the anchor placement, speed and duration of animations.

---

## What is the example 4 exploring?

- Example 4 is based on the following animation example from code pen: (http://codepen.io/michalsnik/pen/WxvNvE)
- It explores how content could be shown on the websites through different animations such as: scrolling down while the background of an element changes from red to green to highlight a change.
- In this example instead of the background changing from red to green, we included a picture to appear with the product as you scroll down to indicate properties of the product such as vegan product which was made in CSS.
- The example also explored the duration of the animations.
- Intially, example 4 was to explore a horizontal scroll animations, but that wasn't possible with this library. Instead, the pixels of background picture are translated onto the x-axis when scrolled to imitate a horizional scroll animation.
